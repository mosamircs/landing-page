### **As this project is all about building a dynamic navigation landing page using `JavaScript`, some missing functionalities are required.**

1. No smooth scroll functionality.
2. No active class applied to the section in the viewport.
3. No highlight for the navigation items.

### Some tips to follow:

- Build a landing page with those specific features:
    - Four sections (hard-coded or dynamically).
    - Four navbar items corresponding to each section (dynamically).
    - Clicking the navbar item >>> scrolling the viewport to the target section. Check [this link](https://bit.ly/scroll-view).
    - Clicking the navbar item >>> highlighting the item background for the user to follow easily where s/he is surfing. Check [this link](http://bit.ly/highlight02).
- Make sure to follow the [rubrics](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2658/view) by:
    - Checking your page on small devices.
    - Adding the **README.md** file with some basic information like project description, instructions, technologies used, author's name. credits, ....etc.
